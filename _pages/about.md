<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am currently a Research Professor at the School of Computing, Kyung Hee University (KHU), Yongin, South Korea. 

I obtained my B.E. degree and M.E. degree from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST) in 2016 and 2019, respectively, and obtained my Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Kyung Hee University (KHU), Yongin, South Korea, in 2025, supervised by [Prof. Choong Seon Hong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oKANWloAAAAJ&hl=en). I also served as a Software Engineer at Spreadtrum Communications (UNISOC), Shanghai, China, from 2019 to 2022. 

My research interests are in efficient & trustworthy AI, federated learning, and adversarial machine learning. 

**I am currently on the job market, seeking a full-time research or teaching position. Please feel free to reach out if you have potential job opportunities.**
