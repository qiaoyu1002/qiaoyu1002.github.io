<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am currently a Research Professor at the School of Computing, Kyung Hee University (KHU), South Korea. 

I obtained my M.E. degree at the School of Computing from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST), China, in 2019, supervised by [Prof. Zilong Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t06H6QgAAAAJ&hl=en), and my Ph.D. degree at School of Computing from Kyung Hee University (KHU), South Korea, in 2025, supervised by [Prof. Choong Seon Hong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oKANWloAAAAJ&hl=en). I also served as a Camera Software Engineer at Spreadtrum Communications (UNISOC), Shanghai, China, from 2019 to 2022. 

My research interests are in efficient & trustworthy AI, federated learning, and adversarial machine learning. I am currently on the job market, <span style="color:red;">seeking a full-time postdoctoral research or teaching position</span>.
